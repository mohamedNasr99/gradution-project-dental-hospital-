    to doctors, and oversee the operations of the clinic. This gives administrators greater control and 
    enables them to optimize resource allocation

    their unique codes. They can write examination reports, prescribe treatments, and even send 
    patients to other clinics or reschedule appointments if necessary. The system helps doctors 
    manage patient data and facilitates a smoother workflow.
